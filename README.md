# Digital Innovation - Coding Project
Dear Students,

this is the repository for our DI coding project. You will find all information and assignments here. The code we produce during the tutorial sessions will be pushed to this repo, so you can build upon it for your homework assignments. Example solutions for the assignments will also be added to this repo.

## Schedule
### Wednesdays - Live Coding Sessions 
Our live coding sessions will be held from 12:**00**pm to 1:**30**pm. Zoom Meeting URL can be found in LSF

### Fridays - Consultation
I will be available for questions and problems every Friday from 3pm to 5pm. This is a voluntary offer to everyone. You can just join the Zoom Meeting and get help, if you are stuck somewhere. We will reuse the lecture Zoom meeting for the consultation, URL can be found in LSF.\
Exception: The third consultation will be held on Thursday, 23.12.2021, instead of Friday.

## Assignment until 15.12.2021
For an introduction to React, please follow [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). Please follow the "Setup Option 2" as you can familiarize yourself with your local coding environment that way. You don't need to implement the "Time Travel" feature (but you can, if you want to 😉)

Please set up a mongoDB Database. As said in our session, you can either set it up locally, or use the [hosting service Atlas](https://account.mongodb.com/account/register). Detailed instructions can be found in ATLAS.md.

## Used Tools
- [Latest version of NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) \
  Node JS is the engine that allows us to run JavaScript files on our computers. It is needed for the development of our application.
- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) \
  git is a tool for version control of our source code. It helps organize changes and allows a rollback to previous versions, should we mess up somewhere.
- Graphical git tool: e.g. [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) \
  as git in the command line is a bit hard to get into, we will be using a graphical git tool. It enables us to visualize our git repo and allows us to use git without the need to learn all the command line commands.
- JS IDE: e.g. [Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/) (Pro version is free of charge for students) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) \
  This is where we will be coding our project. We could also use a plane text editor, but an IDE has many cool and helpful functionalities.
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) \
  This is a tool to test the API endpoints of our backend.

\* I will be using SourceTree and Webstorm in our sessions

In our next coding session, I will show you all the tools, so you know what they do and how they work.
